## Background

A blood bank is a place where blood is collected and stored before providing it to the patients in need. Blood banks are usually scattered all over the place and are not easily accessible to the individuals who need them because of either health emergencies or blood shortages. Hence it is vital that the blood banks have a organized database by help of which blood units can be supplied within the shortest time possible. Blood donations drives are hosted in various organizations, universities, etc. The process of managing the blood bag that is received from the blood donation events needs a proper and systematic management. The main purpose of this database is to keep an organize records management of blood inventory. It would be a great help in the properly monitoring of blood available in the blood bank and for easy processing of blood request. Purpose of the database is to have stored information about the Donor, the Recipient, Medical personnel, how much and when the blood was donated, and whenever there was a transaction made between the donor, the medical personnel, and the recipient.
